      <p>Hey! Welcome to my portfolio. I was born in the Philippines and I moved to New Jersey when I was just two years old. I'm currently enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and having a great time.</p>

      <p>I'm obsessed with learning. My dad told me when I was six years old I spent an hour opening the door to the fridge because I wanted to know how it worked. Eventually that curiousity lead me to mess with video games and I used that new understanding to modify it to my liking.</p>

      <p>This obsession lead me to get into multiple hobbies such as guitar, dance , photography and video editing for my YouTube channel.</p>
